A browser-based AWS photo manager where users can upload, view, and delete images using S3 and Cognito.

## Overview

This project is a serverless photo album app deployed on AWS. Users interact with a browser interface to manage photos in an Amazon S3 bucket. The app uses Amazon Cognito to authorize access for unauthenticated users, and the AWS SDK for JavaScript to handle upload, view, and delete operations.
